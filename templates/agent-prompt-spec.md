# Agent Task Specification

## Context
I am practicing Spec-Driven Development. I have defined the requirements in the attached Spec file.
Your job is to act as the "Implementation Engine" and the "Validator".

## The Spec
[Paste Spec Content Here or Attach File]

## Your Task
1. **Analyze**: Read the spec and identify any missing edge cases.
2. **Implement**: Write the code to fulfill this spec EXACTLY.
    - Do not add features not in the spec.
    - Do not skip validations defined in the spec.
3. **Verify**: Write a script to prove your implementation matches the spec.

## Output Requirements
- Use [Language/Framework]
- Follow [Style Guide]
- Output the verification script first, then the code.
